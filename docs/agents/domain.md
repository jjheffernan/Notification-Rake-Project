# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

**Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (when created).

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md          ← lazy-created by /grill-with-docs or /domain-modeling
├── docs/adr/           ← architectural decision records
├── PLAN.md             ← deployment roadmap + phase tracking
└── docs/reference/     ← readiness, 12-factor, security rubrics
```

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, if it exists.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- **`PLAN.md`** — current phase, scores, and sub-agent task IDs for deployment work.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
